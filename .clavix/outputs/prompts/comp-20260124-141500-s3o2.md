# Improved Prompt

## SEO Implementation for kroam.xyz Football Predictions Platform

### Objective
Implement comprehensive SEO improvements for kroam.xyz, a Next.js football predictions platform featuring 26 AI models. Execute all 4 phases as quickly as possible to maximize organic search visibility.

### Current State (Confirmed)
- Framework: Next.js (version TBD from codebase)
- URL structure: /predictions/{league}/{team-vs-team-date}
- Unique value: AI model predictions with post-match accuracy tracking
- Google Search Console: Not yet configured

### Phase 1: Technical Foundation (Priority: Critical)

#### 1.1 Dynamic Metadata
Update page metadata generation for match prediction pages:

**Title Tag Template:**
`{HomeTeam} vs {AwayTeam} Prediction ({DD MMM YYYY}) | {League} AI Forecasts`

**Meta Description Template:**
`AI predictions for {HomeTeam} vs {AwayTeam} ({League}, {Date}). See forecasts from 26 AI models, pre-match odds analysis, and post-match accuracy report.`

**Implementation:**
- Locate existing metadata configuration (likely `generateMetadata` in app router or `Head` component)
- Extract match data (teams, league, date) from page props/params
- Apply templates dynamically

#### 1.2 SportsEvent JSON-LD Schema
Add structured data to each match page:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SportsEvent",
  "name": "{HomeTeam} vs {AwayTeam}",
  "startDate": "{ISO-8601 datetime}",
  "location": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "{Stadium Name}"
  },
  "homeTeam": { "@type": "SportsTeam", "name": "{HomeTeam}" },
  "awayTeam": { "@type": "SportsTeam", "name": "{AwayTeam}" },
  "eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventScheduled"
}
```

Post-match, add: `"result"` with final score.

#### 1.3 XML Sitemap Generation
Create dynamic sitemap including:
- All match prediction pages (past and upcoming)
- League hub pages (/predictions/{league}/)
- Model leaderboard page
- Model profile pages (Phase 2)

Submit to Google Search Console after setup.

#### 1.4 Canonical Tags
Add self-referencing canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content from query parameters.

### Phase 2: Content Architecture

#### 2.1 Expand Match Page Content
Add sections to each match page:
- Head-to-head: Last 5 meetings between teams
- Recent form: Last 5 match results for each team
- League standings: Current position for both teams
- Key stats: Goals scored/conceded, clean sheets

#### 2.2 Model Profile Pages (New)
Create pages at `/models/{model-slug}` showing:
- Overall accuracy percentage
- Accuracy breakdown by league
- Best/worst predictions (top 5 each)
- Performance trend chart

#### 2.3 League Hub Pages (New/Enhanced)
Build comprehensive `/predictions/{league}/` pages:
- Upcoming matches with predictions
- Recent results with model performance
- League-specific model accuracy rankings
- Internal links to all match pages in that league

#### 2.4 Internal Linking Strategy
On each match page, add links to:
- Both teams' next scheduled matches
- League hub page
- Top 3 performing models for that league
- Previous H2H encounters

### Phase 3: Indexing Infrastructure

#### 3.1 Google Search Console
- Verify site ownership
- Submit XML sitemap
- Monitor indexing coverage
- Track crawl errors

#### 3.2 IndexNow Integration
Implement ping to search engines when:
- New match predictions are published
- Match results come in (post-match update)

#### 3.3 Robots.txt
Configure to:
- Allow crawling of all valuable pages
- Block duplicate/thin auto-generated pages (if any)
- Allow CSS/JS for proper rendering

#### 3.4 Core Web Vitals Audit
Verify performance metrics:
- LCP < 2.5s
- CLS < 0.1
- INP < 200ms

### Phase 4: Authority Building (Ongoing)

#### 4.1 Content Marketing
Monthly "AI Model Performance Report" blog posts targeting:
- "AI football predictions accuracy"
- "best AI for sports betting"
- "machine learning football predictions"

#### 4.2 Social Proof
- Share accuracy stats on Twitter/X
- Highlight notable correct predictions

#### 4.3 League Expansion Priority
1. Premier League
2. Champions League
3. Serie A
4. Bundesliga

### Success Criteria
| Metric | Target (3 months) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Indexed pages | 90%+ of match pages |
| Organic impressions | +200% from baseline |
| Organic clicks | +300% from baseline |
| Target keyword position | Top 20 for match terms |

### Technical Constraints

- Preserve existing URL patterns
- No breaking changes to current functionality
- Schema must validate in Google Rich Results Test

### Expected Outputs
1. Updated metadata generation for all match pages
2. JSON-LD schema component for SportsEvent
3. Dynamic sitemap generation
4. New page components: Model profiles, League hubs
5. Enhanced match page layout with additional content sections
6. IndexNow integration
7. robots.txt configuration
8. Google Search Console verification file

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Component-First Approach
Create reusable SEO components first, then apply across pages:
- `<DynamicMeta>` - Handles title/description
- `<SportsEventSchema>` - JSON-LD injection
- `<CanonicalLink>` - Self-referencing canonical
- `<InternalLinks>` - Related content links

**Best for:** Clean architecture, easier testing, maintainability

### 2. Page-by-Page Approach
Implement all SEO features on match pages first, then expand to new page types:
1. Perfect match page SEO → 2. League hubs → 3. Model profiles

**Best for:** Faster time-to-value, incremental deployment

### 3. Data-Layer First Approach
Enhance the data model/API first to support all SEO content:
- Add H2H history to match data
- Add accuracy stats to model data
- Add standings to league data

Then build UI components that consume this data.

**Best for:** If data is currently missing, this prevents rework

## Validation Checklist

Before considering SEO implementation complete, verify:

- [ ] Title tags include date and league for all match pages
- [ ] Meta descriptions are unique and <160 characters
- [ ] JSON-LD validates in Google Rich Results Test
- [ ] Sitemap accessible at /sitemap.xml
- [ ] Sitemap submitted to Google Search Console
- [ ] All match pages have self-referencing canonicals
- [ ] Model profile pages render with accurate stats
- [ ] League hub pages list all matches with predictions
- [ ] Internal links appear on match pages
- [ ] IndexNow pings fire on new predictions
- [ ] robots.txt allows Googlebot access
- [ ] Core Web Vitals pass (LCP, CLS, INP)
- [ ] Google Search Console shows increasing indexed pages

## Edge Cases

1. **Matches without stadium data** - Schema needs fallback or omit location
2. **Postponed/cancelled matches** - Update eventStatus in schema
3. **Teams with special characters** - URL encoding for slugs
4. **New leagues added** - Sitemap and hub pages auto-generate
5. **Models removed/renamed** - Model profile URLs need redirects
6. **Historical matches** - Should old matches be indexed or noindexed?
7. **Pre-match vs post-match content** - Schema changes after kickoff
8. **Rate limiting on IndexNow** - Batch pings for bulk updates

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Schema validation errors | Test each schema type before deployment |
| Sitemap too large (>50k URLs) | Implement sitemap index with split files |
| Duplicate content from filters/sorting | Canonical tags + robots meta |
| Slow page load from additional content | Lazy load H2H/stats sections |
| IndexNow quota exceeded | Implement queue with rate limiting |
| Broken internal links | Validate links exist before rendering |
| SEO changes break existing rankings | Gradual rollout, monitor Search Console |
