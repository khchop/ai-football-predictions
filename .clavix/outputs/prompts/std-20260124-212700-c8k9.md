# Improved Prompt

**Objective:** Redesign match card layouts across the application to be more space-efficient, matching the compact density of FotMob's UI.

**Current Issues:**
- Homepage match cards have excessive vertical spacing
- Match results pages use too much screen real estate per match
- Large gaps between match elements reduce information density

**Target Design Reference:**
Use FotMob's compact layout approach where:
- Match cards are condensed (single-line team names, smaller logos)
- Minimal padding between elements
- Tighter vertical rhythm
- More matches visible per screen

**Specific Components to Update:**
1. **Match Cards** (homepage and matches list):
   - Reduce card height from current size to ~60-80px
   - Compress team logo size (suggest 32px → 24px)
   - Single-line team names (truncate if needed)
   - Reduce padding: 16px → 8px vertical, 12px → 8px horizontal

2. **Score Display**:
   - Inline score positioning (between team names, not separate row)
   - Smaller font size for scores

3. **Match Metadata** (time, status, venue):
   - Reduce font sizes by 1-2px
   - Tighter line-height (1.5 → 1.3)

4. **Overall Layout**:
   - Reduce gap between match cards: 16px → 8px
   - Compress section headers
   - Aim for 8-10 matches visible per viewport (currently ~4-5)

**Pages Affected:**
- Homepage (`/` - recent matches section)
- Matches page (`/matches`)
- Results pages (`/predictions/[league]` - results tab)
- League-specific pages

**Technical Context:**
- Frontend: Next.js 16 + React
- UI Framework: Tailwind CSS (likely using utility classes)
- Components location: `src/components/match-card.tsx` (or similar)

**Expected Output:**
- Updated MatchCard component with compressed styling
- Reduced spacing utility classes
- Responsive adjustments maintained
- Typography scale adjustments

**Success Criteria:**
- Card height reduced by 30-40%
- 2x more matches visible per screen
- Design remains readable on mobile
- Matches FotMob's visual density without copying exact styling

## Quality Scores
- **Clarity**: 40% → 85%
- **Efficiency**: 70% → 80%
- **Structure**: 50% → 90%
- **Completeness**: 25% → 85%
- **Actionability**: 30% → 90%
- **Specificity**: 20% → 80%
- **Overall**: 36% → 85% (good)
