# Improved Prompt

**Objective:** Debug data mismatch between AI-generated prediction text and displayed prediction scores on match prediction pages

**Problem Description:**
On the match prediction page (example: https://kroam.xyz/predictions/la-liga/rayo-vallecano-vs-osasuna-2026-01-24), there's a discrepancy:
- **AI Model Prediction text section**: Shows AI-generated narrative text describing the prediction
- **Prediction scores display**: Shows actual score predictions (predominantly 1-1)
- **Issue**: The narrative text doesn't match the displayed scores

**Investigation Scope:**
1. Identify where the AI prediction text is generated
2. Identify where the prediction scores are generated
3. Find the data flow between these two components
4. Determine which data source each component uses

**Technical Context:**
- Project: Betting soccer prediction platform (kroam.xyz)
- Focus area: Match prediction pages
- URL pattern: `/predictions/{league}/{match-slug}-{date}`

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Locate the component/file that generates "AI Model Prediction" text
2. Locate the component/file that renders prediction scores
3. Trace data sources for both (database queries, API calls, AI model outputs)
4. Compare timestamp/version of data being used by each component
5. Check if caching or stale data is involved

**Expected Outcome:**
- Root cause identified (e.g., different data sources, timing issue, caching problem)
- File paths and line numbers of relevant code
- Specific fix recommendation

**Success Criteria:**
- AI prediction text accurately reflects displayed prediction scores
- Both components use consistent data source
- No stale or cached data causing mismatches

## Quality Scores
- **Clarity**: 65%
- **Efficiency**: 75%
- **Structure**: 60%
- **Completeness**: 45%
- **Actionability**: 50%
- **Specificity**: 55%
- **Overall**: 57% (needs-improvement)
