# Improved Prompt

**Objective:** Enhance individual model profile pages with model name, AI-generated description, and comprehensive statistics

**Current Issue:**
The model profile page (e.g., https://kroam.xyz/models/cogito-109b-moe) is missing key information:
- No model name displayed prominently
- No description explaining what the model is
- Limited statistics shown

**Requirements:**

1. **Model Name Display**
   - Show the model's display name prominently at the top of the page
   - Include the provider name (e.g., "by Together AI")

2. **AI-Generated Model Description** (2-3 sentences)
   - Brief explanation of what the model is
   - Key characteristics (parameter count, architecture type if available)
   - Store in database to avoid regenerating on each page load

3. **Enhanced Statistics Section**
   - Overall accuracy percentage
   - Total predictions made
   - Accuracy breakdown by league/competition
   - Accuracy breakdown by prediction type (home win, draw, away win)
   - Best/worst prediction streaks
   - Average points per prediction
   - Rank among all models

**Technical Context:**
- Project: kroam.xyz betting predictions platform
- Page route: `/models/[slug]`
- Framework: Next.js with TypeScript
- Data source: `predictions` table, `models` table

**Expected Output:**
- Updated model profile page component with name and description
- New database field or table for model descriptions (if needed)
- Enhanced stats queries/display

**Success Criteria:**
- Model name visible immediately on page load
- Description provides useful context about the model
- Users can compare model performance across different dimensions
