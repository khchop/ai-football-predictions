<objective>
User runs Ahrefs site audit against kroam.xyz, reviews results, and either confirms v2.6 milestone completion or identifies remaining issues for a fix cycle.

Purpose: This is the final verification gate for the entire v2.6 SEO/GEO Site Health milestone (Phases 44-48). The user runs Ahrefs manually (Claude cannot access Ahrefs). If issues are found, Claude fixes them in this same plan.
Output: Ahrefs audit results reviewed, any new issues fixed, v2.6 milestone status determined.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Run Ahrefs Site Audit</name>
  <what-built>
The site has been fully prepared for Ahrefs audit:
- All SEO fixes from Phases 44-47 deployed (redirects, canonicals, sitemaps, meta tags, structured data)
- TTFB profiled and optimized where possible (Phase 48, Plans 01-02)
- All 6 audit passes green against production
- Pre-Ahrefs spot-checks verified (sitemap, robots.txt, redirects, sample pages, breadcrumbs)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Go to Ahrefs Site Audit (https://app.ahrefs.com/site-audit)
2. Run a new crawl against https://kroam.xyz
3. Wait for crawl to complete
4. Check the Health Score (target: >90)
5. Check for any Critical (red) or High-severity errors
6. Share results: health score, number of errors by severity, and any specific critical/high issues found

If health score >90 and zero critical/high errors: type "passed" to complete v2.6 milestone
If issues found: describe the specific errors and Claude will fix them
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Share Ahrefs results: health score, critical errors count, and any specific issues. Type "passed" if health score >90 with zero critical/high errors.</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Fix Any New Issues from Ahrefs (if needed)</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
This task only executes if the user reports issues from the Ahrefs audit.

Per user decision: "If Ahrefs reveals NEW issues not covered by phases 44-47, fix them in this phase (this is the cleanup phase)."

For each issue reported by the user:
1. Identify the root cause (which page type, which check failed)
2. Determine if it's fixable in this phase:
   - Broken URLs: update sitemap or fix route
   - Missing meta tags: update metadata generation
   - Redirect issues: update middleware
   - Structured data errors: update schema generation
   - Content issues: update content generation
3. Apply the fix
4. Deploy and verify the fix resolves the issue

If issues are complex and require architectural changes, document them for a potential future phase rather than attempting risky changes.

After fixes are deployed, ask the user to re-run Ahrefs to verify improvements.

If the user reported "passed" (health score >90, zero critical/high), skip this task entirely.
  </action>
  <verify>
If fixes were needed: re-deploy and ask user to verify with Ahrefs re-crawl
If no fixes needed: skip verification
  </verify>
  <done>Either: (a) Ahrefs passed on first try with >90 health score, or (b) Issues fixed and re-verified with Ahrefs re-crawl showing >90 health score.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Ahrefs health score >90
2. Zero critical or high-severity Ahrefs errors
3. Any new issues either fixed or documented for future work
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Ahrefs health score >90 (hard requirement per user decision)
- Zero critical/high-severity errors in Ahrefs
- v2.6 milestone status determined (complete or needs additional work)
</success_criteria>
