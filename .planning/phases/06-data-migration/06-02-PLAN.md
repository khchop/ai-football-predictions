<objective>
Create user-facing documentation explaining the accuracy correction.

Purpose: Communicate the formula fix transparently so users understand why their model's accuracy numbers changed.

Output: Permanent methodology page at /methodology and changelog entry documenting the correction.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create methodology page</name>
  <files>src/app/methodology/page.tsx, src/app/methodology/layout.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a permanent page at `/methodology` explaining how accuracy is calculated.

**Page content structure:**

1. **Hero Section:**
   - Title: "How We Calculate Accuracy"
   - Subtitle: "Our methodology for measuring AI prediction performance"

2. **The Formula Section:**
   - Clear explanation of tendency accuracy
   - Formula: `Accuracy = (Correct Tendencies / Scored Predictions) * 100`
   - Define terms:
     - **Correct Tendency**: Prediction where the model correctly predicted the match outcome (home win, draw, or away win), earning tendency points
     - **Scored Predictions**: Predictions for matches that have finished and been scored

3. **What Counts as Correct:**
   - Home win predicted, home team won = correct
   - Draw predicted, match ended in draw = correct
   - Away win predicted, away team won = correct
   - Points are awarded using the Kicktipp quota system

4. **What's NOT Included:**
   - Pending predictions (match not yet played)
   - Voided predictions (match cancelled)
   - Exact score accuracy is tracked separately

5. **Technical Note:**
   - Brief mention that we use `tendencyPoints > 0` as the correctness check
   - This ensures only genuinely correct predictions count (not just scored ones)

**Implementation:**
- Use existing layout/styling patterns from other pages (check src/app/about or similar)
- Include proper metadata (title, description) for SEO
- Make it linkable - this is a permanent reference page

**Layout file:** Simple layout wrapping the page, following existing patterns.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run dev server and visit http://localhost:3000/methodology

Expected:
- Page renders without errors
- Clear explanation of accuracy formula
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Proper metadata in page source
  </verify>
  <done>
Methodology page created at /methodology with clear formula explanation and proper styling.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create changelog entry</name>
  <files>CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
Create or update CHANGELOG.md with an entry documenting the accuracy correction.

**If CHANGELOG.md doesn't exist:** Create it with standard format (Keep a Changelog style).

**Changelog entry content:**

```markdown
## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

#### Accuracy Calculation Correction

We fixed a bug in how model accuracy was calculated. The previous formula incorrectly counted some predictions as "correct" when they should not have been counted.

**What changed:**
- Old formula: Counted predictions where `tendencyPoints` was not null (included 0-point wrong predictions)
- New formula: Counts predictions where `tendencyPoints > 0` (only genuinely correct predictions)

**Impact:**
- Most models show ~5-8% lower accuracy than before
- This is the CORRECT accuracy - the old numbers were inflated
- Rankings may shift slightly as the correction affects some models more than others

**Example corrections:**
| Model | Old Accuracy | New Accuracy | Change |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| [Model 1 from verification report] | X% | Y% | -Z% |
| [Model 2 from verification report] | X% | Y% | -Z% |
| [Model 3 from verification report] | X% | Y% | -Z% |

**Why this matters:**
The corrected numbers give you a true picture of model performance. A model showing 52% accuracy now genuinely predicts correctly 52% of the time.

**Rollback:**
Historical data is preserved for 30 days. If you notice any issues, please report them.

**More information:**
See our [Methodology page](/methodology) for full details on how we calculate accuracy.
```

**Use verification report data:**
Read `.planning/phases/06-data-migration/verification-report.json` to populate the example corrections table with real before/after values. Pick 3 representative models (one with typical delta, one with larger delta, one well-known model if identifiable).
  </action>
  <verify>
Check CHANGELOG.md exists and contains:
```bash
grep -A 5 "Accuracy Calculation Correction" CHANGELOG.md
```

Expected: Entry with before/after table populated with real data from verification report.
  </verify>
  <done>
CHANGELOG.md updated with accuracy correction entry including real before/after data from verification report.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Link methodology page from footer</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/footer.tsx (or equivalent)</files>
  <action>
Add a link to the methodology page in the site footer or appropriate navigation area.

1. Find the footer component (likely `src/components/layout/footer.tsx` or similar)
2. Add "Methodology" or "How We Calculate" link pointing to `/methodology`
3. Place it in an appropriate section (e.g., "About" or "Resources" links)

If no footer exists, skip this task and note in summary that methodology page is accessible via direct URL only.
  </action>
  <verify>
Visit homepage and scroll to footer. Verify methodology link exists and navigates correctly.

If no footer: Verify `/methodology` is accessible via direct URL.
  </verify>
  <done>
Methodology page linked from site footer (or accessible via direct URL if no footer).
  </done>
</task>

Phase 6 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:

3. User can view explanation of why accuracy numbers changed (changelog, methodology page)
   - Verify: /methodology page loads with formula explanation
   - Verify: CHANGELOG.md contains accuracy correction entry with before/after examples

Combined with Plan 06-01 verifications, this completes all Phase 6 success criteria.
