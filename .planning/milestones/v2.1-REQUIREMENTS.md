## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v2.1.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Model pages redesign | Separate scope, not related to match page fixes |
| New navigation patterns | Focus is simplification, not redesign |
| Mobile app | Web-only platform |
| Additional content sections | Goal is to remove, not add |

## Traceability
