# Requirements: AI Football Predictions Platform

**Defined:** 2026-02-02
**Core Value:** Prediction pipeline reliably generates scores from 35 LLMs before kickoff and accurately calculates Kicktipp quota points when matches complete

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for Stats Accuracy & SEO milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Stats Calculation

- [x] **STAT-01**: All accuracy calculations use single standardized formula (`tendencyPoints > 0` / scored predictions) — v1.1 Phase 5
- [x] **STAT-02**: Fix IS NOT NULL vs > 0 mismatch in `getTopModelsByCompetition()` and `getModelPredictionStats()` — v1.1 Phase 5
- [x] **STAT-03**: Add NULLIF() protection to all division operations in stats queries — v1.1 Phase 5
- [x] **STAT-04**: Consistent denominators across all queries (scored predictions only, not all predictions) — v1.1 Phase 5
- [x] **STAT-05**: Create canonical stats service layer to centralize calculation logic — v1.1 Phase 5
- [x] **STAT-06**: Model detail page shows correct tendency accuracy (not exact score %) — v1.1 Phase 5

### Data Migration

- [x] **MIGR-01**: Recalculate historical accuracy for all models using corrected formula — v1.1 Phase 6
- [x] **MIGR-02**: Invalidate all stats-related caches atomically after recalculation — v1.1 Phase 6
- [x] **MIGR-03**: Verify leaderboard rankings match corrected calculations — v1.1 Phase 6

### SEO Enhancement

- [x] **SEO-01**: Add Schema.org SportsEvent structured data to match pages — v1.1 Phase 7
- [x] **SEO-02**: Add Schema.org Article structured data to blog/roundup pages — v1.1 Phase 7
- [x] **SEO-03**: Add BreadcrumbList structured data to all pages — v1.1 Phase 7

- [x] **UX-02**: Add tooltips explaining what each metric means — v1.1 Phase 8
- [x] **UX-03**: Leaderboard shows correct, trustworthy numbers after stats fix — v1.1 Phase 8

## v1.2+ Requirements (Deferred)

Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Advanced Metrics

- **ADV-01**: Model calibration metrics (how well probabilities match outcomes)
- **ADV-02**: Brier score calculation for prediction quality
- **ADV-03**: "What if" scenarios showing potential points

### GEO/Internationalization

- **GEO-01**: Spanish translations for key pages (largest football market)
- **GEO-02**: Hreflang tags for international SEO
- **GEO-03**: Football vs Soccer terminology by locale

### Advanced UX

- **AUX-01**: Visual performance comparison charts
- **AUX-02**: Model personality profiles
- **AUX-03**: Programmatic model × competition pages

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time prediction changes | Predictions locked at kickoff, changing creates trust issues |
| User accounts/predictions | View-only platform by design |
| Additional LLM providers | Together AI sufficient, adding complexity without benefit |
| Mobile native app | Web-first, responsive design covers mobile |
| Calibration metrics | Requires probability tracking infrastructure, defer to v1.2 |
| Full i18n | Complexity, defer to v1.2 after SEO foundation |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
