# Milestone v2.1: Match Page Simplification

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-03
**Phases:** 24-25
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

v2.1 simplifies the match detail page by removing the sticky header, mobile tabs, and unused sections (H2H, standings) while fixing HTML rendering issues in narrative content. Two phases: one for layout/filtering changes (all touch the same page), one for content rendering fixes (different scope).

## Phases

### Phase 24: Match Page Cleanup

**Goal**: Match page displays as a single scrollable page with unified layout order and no empty/hidden sections
**Depends on**: Phase 23 (v2.0 completion)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 24-01: Remove sticky header and mobile tabbed navigation
- [x] 24-02: Unify layout order and filter unused sections

**Details:**

Success criteria achieved:
1. ✓ User scrolls the entire match page naturally without sticky header repositioning
2. ✓ Mobile and desktop users see the same single-column layout (no tab navigation)
3. ✓ Content appears in order: Score, Scorers/Goals, Odds, Pre-match, Prediction, Post-match, Predictions Table, FAQ
4. ✓ H2H and league standings sections are not visible on any match page
5. ✓ Sections with no data are completely hidden (no "unavailable" placeholders)

Requirements satisfied: LAYT-01, LAYT-02, LAYT-03, FILT-01, FILT-02, FILT-03, FILT-04

### Phase 25: Content Rendering Fix

**Goal**: Narrative content displays as clean formatted text without visible HTML tags
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 25-01: Strip HTML tags from narrative content using isomorphic-dompurify

**Details:**

Success criteria achieved:
1. ✓ Pre-match, prediction, and post-match narratives display formatted text without raw HTML tags
2. ✓ Database content is clean (no HTML fragments in stored narrative text via render-time stripping)

Requirements satisfied: QUAL-01, QUAL-02

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Single-column layout for all devices (Rationale: Eliminates UX divergence between mobile/desktop)
- Decision: Keep MatchPageHeader as pass-through (Rationale: Maintains API surface without sticky logic)
- Decision: Complete removal of H2H (Rationale: Not valuable to users, clutters interface)
- Decision: Complete removal of standings (Rationale: Redundant with league page, reduces API calls)
- Decision: Return null for empty sections (Rationale: Cleaner UX than showing "no data" placeholders)
- Decision: isomorphic-dompurify for HTML stripping (Rationale: SSR-compatible with Next.js App Router)
- Decision: Strip at render time (Rationale: Preserves original content in database for flexibility)

**Issues Resolved:**

- HTML tags appearing in narrative content (pre-match, betting, post-match)
- Sticky header causing scroll position issues
- Mobile/desktop UX divergence with different navigation patterns
- Empty sections showing placeholder messages

**Issues Deferred:** None

**Technical Debt Incurred:** None
