# v2.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v2.0 UI/UX Overhaul
**Audited:** 2026-02-03T12:30:00Z
**Status:** TECH_DEBT (all requirements met, no blockers, accumulated debt needs review)

## Executive Summary

v2.0 milestone is **complete** with all 33 requirements satisfied. The integration health is strong at 87% with all 4 E2E user flows verified. However, Phase 17 Design System established infrastructure that wasn't fully adopted by later phases, resulting in orphaned components and unused semantic tokens.

**Recommendation:** Complete milestone and track design system adoption as backlog item for future iteration.

## Tech Debt by Phase

### Phase 17: Design System Foundation

**Category:** Adoption (infrastructure complete, consumption deferred)

| Item | Impact | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| ThemeToggle not integrated into Navigation | Medium - users can't toggle theme manually | 2 min |
| MatchBadge component orphaned (0 imports) | Low - inline classes work | 15 min |
| AccuracyBadge component orphaned (0 imports) | Low - inline classes work | 10 min |
| 50+ hardcoded colors vs semantic tokens | Low - visual output identical | 30 min |
| design-tokens.ts exports unused | Low - CSS variables work | N/A |

**Analysis:** Phase 17 established complete infrastructure (tokens, components, theming). Later phases chose inline Tailwind classes over importing new components, likely to avoid regression risk during rebuild. This is a strategic deferral, not a technical failure.

**Recommendation:** Track as backlog. High-value fix: integrate ThemeToggle (2 min). Medium-value: gradually migrate to semantic tokens.

### Phase 18: Match Page Rebuild

**Category:** Resolved

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| PPR cacheComponents disabled | ✓ Resolved in Phase 23 |

**Analysis:** Phase 18 built PPR infrastructure but deferred activation. Phase 23 enabled `cacheComponents: true`. No remaining debt.

---

## Critical Gaps

**None.** All critical requirements are met:
- All 33 v2.0 requirements satisfied
- All 4 E2E flows complete
- No broken integrations blocking functionality
- No unverified phases (all 7 have VERIFICATION.md)

---

## Recommendations

### Option A: Complete Milestone (Recommended)

Accept current tech debt as backlog items. The debt is:
- Low-impact (visual output correct, just missing design system benefits)
- Non-blocking (no functionality broken)
- Documented (VERIFICATION.md files capture details)

**Action:** `/gsd:complete-milestone v2.0`

### Option B: Plan Debt Closure Phase

Create Phase 24 to address:
1. ThemeToggle integration (2 min)
2. MatchBadge/AccuracyBadge adoption (25 min)
3. Semantic token migration (30 min)

**Action:** `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps`
