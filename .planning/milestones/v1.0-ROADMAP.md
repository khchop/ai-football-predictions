# Milestone v1.0: Bug Fix Stabilization

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-01
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 14

## Overview

This milestone fixes 18 critical bugs across the AI Football Predictions Platform to achieve production stability. The fix order follows dependency analysis: stability first (database/workers), then data accuracy (scoring/cache), then performance (Redis/SSR), and finally UX polish (mobile/real-time). Each phase unblocks the next - pool size enables workers, workers enable accurate scoring, accurate scoring enables meaningful UX improvements.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Stability

**Goal**: Prediction pipeline runs without crashes and handles failures gracefully
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CRIT-01, CRIT-02, CRIT-03, CRIT-04, CRIT-05
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Database pool sizing and health monitoring
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Worker error handling and defensive null checks
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — JSON parse recovery with multi-strategy extraction
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Timeout handling and model failure classification

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Database queries complete without "connection pool exhausted" errors under 12+ concurrent workers
2. Queue workers continue processing when API returns null/malformed data (no unhandled exceptions)
3. LLM responses with markdown, extra text, or malformed JSON still produce valid predictions
4. API timeouts trigger appropriate backoff (60s for rate limits, linear for timeouts) without immediate model disable
5. Models auto-disable only after 5 consecutive failures and auto-recover after 1h cooldown

### Phase 2: Data Accuracy

**Goal**: Leaderboard totals and points are calculated correctly with no race conditions
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (stable workers required)
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04, DATA-05
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Settlement transaction with row locking and atomic streak updates
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Quota calculation formula correction to match Kicktipp standard
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Streak tracking edge cases (voided/cancelled/postponed matches)
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Cache invalidation with SCAN and post-transaction timing

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. All 35 predictions for a match are scored exactly once, even under concurrent settlement jobs
2. Leaderboard totals match sum of individual prediction points (no cache-induced discrepancies)
3. Model streaks correctly reset on wrong predictions and ignore voided/cancelled matches
4. Cache shows updated data within 5 seconds of settlement completion
5. Quota points match Kicktipp standard formula (2-6 points based on prediction rarity)

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Performance

**Goal**: Redis operations are non-blocking and pages load quickly
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (correct data required before optimizing delivery)
**Requirements**: INFR-01, INFR-02, INFR-03, INFR-04, UIUX-01
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Match page SSR optimization with streaming Suspense
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Circuit breaker state database persistence
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — API budget enforcement and Redis graceful degradation

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Cache pattern deletion uses SCAN (cursor-based), not KEYS (blocking)
2. Match detail pages with 35+ predictions load in under 2 seconds (streamed)
3. Circuit breaker state survives Redis restarts (persisted to database fallback)
4. API-Football requests are tracked against daily budget (100/day free tier)
5. System continues functioning when Redis is unavailable (degraded mode, no crashes)

### Phase 4: UX Polish

**Goal**: Frontend is responsive, real-time, and handles errors gracefully
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (performance must be stable before polish)
**Requirements**: UIUX-02, UIUX-03, UIUX-04
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Mobile responsive prediction cards
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Leaderboard auto-refresh with LiveTabRefresher
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Error boundary coverage with react-error-boundary

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Prediction cards display correctly on mobile without horizontal scrolling
2. Leaderboard updates visible within 30 seconds of settlement (polling or cache-busting)
3. React rendering failures show error UI, not white screens (error boundaries catch all async failures)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Pool size 20 connections | Support 12+ concurrent workers with headroom | ✓ Good |
| Multi-strategy JSON parsing | Handle malformed LLM responses gracefully | ✓ Good |
| Error-type-aware backoff | Different errors need different strategies | ✓ Good |
| FOR UPDATE row locking | Prevent race conditions in concurrent scoring | ✓ Good |
| Kicktipp quota formula | Match official scoring documentation | ✓ Good |
| Streaming SSR with Suspense | Fast TTFB while predictions load async | ✓ Good |
| Dual persistence circuit breaker | Redis fast + database durable | ✓ Good |
| 5-second Redis cooldown | Balance availability with retry overhead | ✓ Good |
| react-error-boundary | Comprehensive async error catching | ✓ Good |

**Issues Resolved:**

- Database pool exhaustion under load
- JSON parse failures on malformed LLM responses
- Model auto-disable triggering prematurely
- Race conditions in concurrent settlement
- Incorrect quota point calculations
- Slow match page loads (35+ predictions)
- Stale leaderboard data after settlement
- White screens on React errors

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None - all implementations production-ready
