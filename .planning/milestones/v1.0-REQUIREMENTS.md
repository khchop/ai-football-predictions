# Requirements: AI Football Predictions Platform

**Defined:** 2026-01-31
**Core Value:** Prediction pipeline reliably generates scores from 35 LLMs before kickoff and accurately calculates Kicktipp quota points when matches complete

## v1 Requirements

Bug fix stabilization milestone. All requirements are fixes to existing functionality.

### Critical Bugs (CRIT)

- [x] **CRIT-01**: JSON parse failures handled with multi-strategy extraction (direct -> markdown -> regex -> score pattern)
- [x] **CRIT-02**: API timeouts recovered gracefully with error-type-aware backoff (rate limit -> 60s, timeout -> linear)
- [x] **CRIT-03**: Model auto-disable uses proper threshold (5 failures) and time-based recovery (1h cooldown)
- [x] **CRIT-04**: Queue workers handle null/malformed API data without crashing (defensive error handling)
- [x] **CRIT-05**: Database connection pool sized appropriately (20+ connections) with health monitoring

### Data Accuracy (DATA)

- [x] **DATA-01**: Settlement uses database transaction with row lock to prevent race conditions
- [x] **DATA-02**: Leaderboard totals calculated correctly (cache invalidation after all predictions scored)
- [x] **DATA-03**: Streak tracking handles voided matches, draws, and cancelled matches correctly
- [x] **DATA-04**: Cache invalidation timing ensures no stale data visible after settlement
- [x] **DATA-05**: Quota point calculation matches Kicktipp standard formula

### UI/UX (UIUX)

- [x] **UIUX-01**: Match detail pages load within acceptable time (streaming predictions, lazy load)
- [x] **UIUX-02**: Leaderboard updates visible without manual refresh (polling or cache-busting)
- [x] **UIUX-03**: Mobile responsiveness for prediction cards (no horizontal scroll required)
- [x] **UIUX-04**: Error boundaries catch all React rendering failures (no white screens)

### Infrastructure (INFR)

- [x] **INFR-01**: Circuit breaker state persists through Redis restarts (prevent API flood on recovery)
- [x] **INFR-02**: Cache pattern deletion uses SCAN instead of KEYS (non-blocking Redis operations)
- [x] **INFR-03**: API rate limits enforced at budget level (prevent free tier exhaustion)
- [x] **INFR-04**: Redis unavailability handled gracefully (system continues without cache)
