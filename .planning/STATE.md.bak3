## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0: Bug fixes only scope — existing platform has fundamental value, stability is priority
- v1.1: Stats accuracy before SEO — incorrect stats in structured data damage SEO more than missing structured data
- 05-01: Use `tendencyPoints > 0` formula (not IS NOT NULL) — prevents ~7% accuracy inflation
- 05-01: NULLIF division protection — prevents errors on models with no scored predictions
- 05-02: Also fixed getModelStatsByCompetitionWithRank — same bug pattern discovered during execution
- 05-03: Label accuracy as "tendency accuracy" in metadata — explicit about what metric means
- 06-01: Snapshot-before-modify pattern — stats_pre_migration table preserves rollback capability
- 06-01: JSON verification report format — machine-readable for blog post, human-readable for review
- 06-01: Bug severity revealed — actual impact -48% not -7% (IS NOT NULL counted 0-point predictions)
- 06-02: /methodology route — top-level URL for permanent accuracy calculation reference
- 06-02: Keep a Changelog format — industry standard for documenting changes
- 06-02: Three diverse examples in changelog — shows impact range without overwhelming
- 07-01: Use EventScheduled for all matches — schema.org has no EventCompleted, signal completion via homeTeamScore/awayTeamScore
- 07-01: Dynamic noindex at 30 days for finished matches — balances crawl budget vs. historical value
- 07-01: Predicted score from likelyScores[0] — most probable outcome per bookmaker odds
- 07-02: Match extraction for roundups — Primary: matchId field, Fallback: parse markdown /matches/ links
- 07-02: Competition pages indexing — Set robots.index: true (were false), competitions are navigation hubs
- 07-02: Unique title templates — Every page type has distinct pattern, site name suffix, under 60 chars

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 6 (Data Migration) - COMPLETE:**
- ✅ User communication addressed: /methodology page and CHANGELOG.md created
- ✅ Bug fix emphasis: Documentation clearly explains IS NOT NULL error
- ✅ Context provided: 50-55% is professional bookmaker range
- ✅ Transparency achieved: Real before/after data from 29 models shown

**Phase 7 (SEO Enhancement) - IN PROGRESS:**
- Google takes 2-4 weeks to re-crawl and update rich snippets after structured data added
- Monitoring: Google Search Console structured data detection + rich snippet impressions
- Test with Google Rich Results Test tool after deployment
